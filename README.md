# CurrencyConverter

Had to adjust the UI slightly so that I could define scaleable AutoLayout rules as this design doesn't fit on an iPhone 4.

I also couldn't match the font exactly as it doesn't seem to match the system Helvetica regular or the bold. 

If I had more time I would have liked to...

* Make the currency picker an infinite scroller
* Had the currencies fade from white to green as they were coming in and out of selection
* Made the results label fade in and out instead of just changing
* Made the dotted view more configurable and reuseable
* Adjust view layout whenever the keyboard appeared and in landscape, so you can see the results at the same time.
